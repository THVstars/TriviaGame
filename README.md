This is my CareerDevs capstone project. It uses HTML, JavaScript and CSS. It's a trivia application that asks the user which trivia category they want to choose. Once that choice is made, they are asked 5 questions from the chosen category generated using an API. Once they submit their answers, they'll be told if they answered correctly or incorrectly and how many points they accumulated based on their number of correct responses.
